# Rail Fence Cipher Message Encryption and Decryption Tool
This project implements a message encryption and decryption tool using the Rail Fence Cipher technique. Built with Python and the Django framework, this application allows users to securely encode and decode messages. The Rail Fence Cipher technique adds an extra layer of privacy to communication by rearranging the letters in a unique pattern.

Technologies Used:

  *Python 
  
  *Django Framework

Features:

  User-friendly interface for inputting messages and selecting encryption/decryption mode.
  
  Implementation of the Rail Fence Cipher technique for message encoding and decoding.
  
  Ensures data privacy by transforming messages into a ciphered format.
  
  Secure Django backend for smooth user interaction.
